- Sort links by order of connection on opposing side (done)
- Fix fact that link padding will not be reduced correctly. (done)
- Can we use scale instead? (done)

- improve linkScale perf (todo)
- Assess convergence of minimizing link crossing algo (todo)
- Add more tests
- Figure out yScaling and link acceptance
- Prevent focus of target nodes



- Right now we show the full flow from nodeA to nodeB
- when click node, filter to only related subnet
- handle rejections. We don't have?


IMPORTANT
- TODO: Prevent selecting target nodes
- TODO: Rename focusNode to selectedNode
- TODO: Filter column nodes based on selected item
- TODO: Highlighting/coloring features
